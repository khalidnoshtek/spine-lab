# BackSignal

**Your Personal Spine Severity Score** — a doctor-verified, video-led screening
for **lower-back (lumbar) pain only**, grounded in the **Spine Severity System
(SSS)** by **Dr Ayush Sharma** (Dept. of Spine Surgery).

Self-contained, hand-editable static site — no build step.

```bash
npm start          # → npx serve .
# or: python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open the served URL (not `file://` — assets load over HTTP).

## What it is

A complete app: a **video-led onboarding assessment** → a **persistent home that
auto-tracks daily habits** from a connected health device → **points & a
redeemable rewards store**. State persists in `localStorage`.

**Onboarding (video-gated):**
`Intro → Connect device → About you → 6 SSS steps → Score`
Each step opens a **5-second clip that locks the form until watched**, then pairs
with exactly the data the SSS chart collects. Completing it earns points.

**Home (after onboarding):** **Today** (Spine Score, adaptive daily **spine-health
tasks** that fire themed confetti and slide out as new ones slide in, habit cards
with pose visuals auto-synced from the device, streaks, points, and a weekly
**insights** panel — walking / sitting / sleep sparklines with a plain-English
read-out), **Plan** (grounded next-steps), **Rewards** (redeem points for real
perks), **Profile** (summary, retake, doctor links).

**Connect a device** (Apple Health / Google Fit / Fitbit, themed brand marks) to
**auto-populate** your name and basics and keep habits updated. The whole app uses
theme-matched line icons (no emoji) and fluid staggered entrance animations.

## The 6-step SSS score (0–11)

| Step | Input | Points |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · Back pain | VAS 0–10 (faces) | 0–3→0, 4–6→1, 7–10→2 |
| 2 · Sciatica | Leg pain / radiculopathy 0–3 | 0–3 |
| 3 · Disability | Modified ODI (5 activities × Normal/Mild/Severe = 0–10) | 0–2→0, 3–5→1, 6–10→2 |
| 4 · Body load | BMI (from height/weight) | <25→0, 25–29.9→1, ≥30→2 |
| 5 · Chronicity | Acute <3wk / Subacute 3–6wk / Chronic >6wk | 0 / 1 / 2 |
| 6 · Red flags | cancer, weight loss, fever, trauma, bladder/bowel, saddle, neuro | any → auto **11** |

**Bands:** 0–3 LOW · 4–6 MILD–MODERATE · 7–9 MODERATE–SEVERE · 10–11 SEVERE/HIGH RISK
→ education / physiotherapy / specialist / urgent care.

The **Daily Habit Snapshot** (sitting/walking/exercise/sleep) is **informational
only** — it does not change the clinical score (per the SSS chart). It can be
auto-filled from a connected health device and updates over time.

## Editing

- **Videos:** each entry in `APP.videos` (top of `index.html`) can take a
  `src` (a self-hosted MP4 — preferred) or a YouTube `id` (fallback); with
  neither, the `script` text shows as a placeholder. The intro ships with a
  real clip at `assets/video/intro.mp4`. When a `src` is set the popup plays a
  native `<video>` and the watch-gate is driven by **actual playback** (shows a
  poster with a play button, plays with sound on tap, unlocks when the clip
  ends). An optional `poster` field sets the still shown before play. Record
  vertical 9:16 clips — intro 30–45s, step clips ~15–25s — and encode with:
  `ffmpeg -i raw.mov -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -pix_fmt yuv420p -crf 22 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart assets/video/<step>.mp4`
- **Links:** `APP.links` (website / research / youtube).
- **Scoring & steps** live in `index.html` (`STEPS` array + scoring helpers),
  kept 1:1 with the SSS chart.

## Scope

- **Lower back / lumbar only** — no cervical/thoracic, no lifting tests (not in
  the source framework).
- Screening & decision-support tool — not a diagnosis or a substitute for
  clinical judgment.
